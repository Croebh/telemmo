If you want to play just grab [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) (They have a webclient if you don't want to download) and search for the bot in your "search" box (@telemmo_bot)

### Description

TeleMMO is a MMORPG inside a bot made for botting platforms. It's based on Idle games, Ragnarok, Tibia, D&D, and many other games we've played in our lives.

### Bots?

Today we have a telegram bot only but our code architecture allows for using as many platforms as we want. Since the telegram-only approach allows us to gurantee a player will have only one account per phone number, we will see how to expand out platform range without hurting the game balance.

### Translations

We've added internacionalization to the game. If you want to help us translate to a language we don't have yet just go to this spreadsheet [Spreadsheet Link (TO BE DONE)](#)

### Bug report

If you found a bug, please open an issue here describing it as much as you can. We hate them as much as you do and we'll try our best to fix it quickly.

### Contribute

If you want to help with the code feel free to send a pull request. Please, check the [Contributor Guidelines (TO BE DONE)](#) before doing it so. We are very open to any change that makes sense, we are also normally avaiable on telegram to talk about coding, new features, and current features maintance.
