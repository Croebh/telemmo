Refactor notes:

- Use ramda for consistency and functional helpers
- Consistent routing between commmon routes and callback queries
- Decouple keyboard from view options (I didn't count for more view options other than keyboard)
- Remove need for an username, some people don't have it and I think it's causing some explosions/
